# F1-Sim-2
Simulates some things related to F1 like teams.
The game is a passion project I started a few weeks ago. It is currently incomplete but I have a lot of features planned.

## Ideas I have Implemented:

- Working Race Simulator | Generates a random grid based on stats, luck and other factors.

## Ideas I want to Implement:

- Team Randomizer | Silly Season has struck! Reassigns the grid to different teams. (Not always different)
- Season Simulator | Simulates one season of Formula 1 and shows the results.
